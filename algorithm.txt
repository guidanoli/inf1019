  Definitions:
  
  - A queue is a list where you can only add nodes in end and remove
  from the beginning
  - A node carries only one information: the procedure id (pid)
  - A procedure is removed from the queue system only when terminated
  or scheduled. The first, for ever; The last, only on its quantum.
  - There are 3 queues: F1, F2, F3. One has a higher priority than
  the other. F1 > F2 > F3. On the other hand, their quantum are
  inversely proportional to their priority. That is, in terms of
  time run by a process in F1 is smaller than on F2, and so on.
  - When initialized, the scheduler puts all procedures in F1.
  - The scheduler runs fully each queue depending on its priority.
  F1 can be run until 4 times, F2 2 times, F1 once. This keeps the
  idea of priority but does not leave procedures with lower
  priority starving.
  
  Pseudo-code explanation:
  
  2: We know all procedures have terminated when all queues are empty
  and no procedures are executing I/O tasks.
  5: If the procedure pointer is null, no procedure is running
  6: 7: The scheduler will wait T u.t. (determined by the current
  procedure's queue) and when done, will stop the current procedure.
  If the current procedure enters an I/O phase, then the scheduler
  will be woken up - and thus, knowing it has finished its CPU phase
  before the quantum.
  8: 10: If not at highest priority, raise its priority. If not at
  lowest priority, lower its priority.
  11: Give it a signal SIGSTOP in order to - well - stop. Remove it
  from its queue and add it on the correct one (or even the same one,
  at the end of it).
  13: Literally do nothing.
  15: From the current queue, give a signal to the process whose pid
  is stored in the node removed (TEMPORARLY)
  
  Communication:
  -------------
  
  The scheduler will signal its programs with the following signals:
    SIGSTOP - Tells its son to stop
    SIGCNT - Tells it to resume executing
  
  And the programs will likewise signal the scheduler with:
    SIGUSR1 - The program has entered I/O
    SIGCHD - The program has ended
  
  SIGSTOP:
    When a program has entered I/O or has ended its quantum, the
    scheduler will preemptively stop its process.
  
  SIGCNT:
    When a program has entered its quantum, it has to be awakened from
    its deep sleep.
    
  SIGUSR1 (I/O):
    When the program enters  I/O by signalling the scheduler with the
    signal SIGUSR1, it creates a thread that holds the program pid and
    stops it, waits some time (in this case, 3 seconds), and then puts
    it on the queue with one level higher of priority.
  
  SIGCHD:
    When the program dies, the scheduler has remove it from its
    internal structure.
  
  Queues:
  ------
  
  Queues are circular (Round-Robin) and have priorities. The higher
  the priority, less time is reserved for a process (because it is
  more I/O bound, thus quicker to execute, and won't consume much of
  the CPU), but more times it will be executed thoroughly. In this
  project, there will be three queues, one twice the priority of
  the other - the least important queue will run once and each
  process can run up to 2^(n-1) u.t., being n = 3, 4 u.t.* .
  Consequently, the most important queue will run 2^(n-1) times,
  that is, 4, and each provess can run up to 1 u.t. .
  
  In C, there will be an auxiliary queue that will store all the
  processes that persisted in the same queue, and when the queue
  empties, they are move the main queue in order. That way it will
  be possible to determine how many times are necessary for a queue
  to be emptied.
  
  * u.t. = unities of time, quantum
  
  Threads:
  -------
  
  There needs to be a thread count. Why? Well, imagine a situation where
  all processes have entered I/O and next time the scheduler checks if
  there are any running processes or processes in any queue, it finds none
  and terminates. This occurrs because in this naive implementation, the
  scheduler was not aware of the processes on I/O waiting to be inserted
  again on the queues.
  
  This problem can be solved by the use of a thread counter that is
  increased before the scheduler creates a thread for a proccess that
  will be entering I/O, and decreased when a given thread is terminated.
  
  Obviously, the use of mutexes is undeniably fundamental to keep the
  counter consistent.
  
  That way, the scheduler not only has to check for processes in its queues
  but also if there is any thread currently handling a process in I/O.
  
  Future improvements:
  -------------------  
  
  * Make scheduler sleep when there are I/O bound processes running but
  none on CPU (queues). Before a I/O process handler thread terminates,
  check if io_processes count is zero, and, if so, it has to wake up
  (signal SIGUSR2) the scheduler.
  
  SIGCHLD:
  -------
  
  This signal is called whenever a child process is terminated, or
  interrupted or resumed. That means that there needs to be some filtering
  and process only those generated when the program is terminated.
  
  This is done by creating a program status, which can be:
  * MANAGING (or normal)
  * EXECUTING
  
  ...when executing, SIGCHLD necessairly means that the child process
  was terminates. Anywhere else in the main function, the scheduler is
  managing, and SIGCHLD will be ignored.
  
  Alternative Algorithm (in pseudo-code, but more progamatic)
  ---------------------
  
  1   def scheduler
  2   | while number of processes > 0
  3   | | queue <- new_queue()
  4   | | quantum <- queue quantum
  5   | | while queue isn't empty
  6   | | | process <- first node from queue
  7   | | | resume process
  8   | | | wait until quantum or io signal
  9   | | | stop process
  10  | | | switch(cause of stop)
  11  | | | | io?
  12  | | | | | create a thread to do:
  13  | | | | | | wait io blocking time
  14  | | | | | | move process queue with higher priority            
  15  | | | | terminated?
  16  | | | | | remove process from queue
  17  | | | | | decrease number of processes
  18  | | | | exceeded quantum?
  19  | | | | | new queue <- lower_priority(queue)
  20  | | | | | is new queue == queue?
  21  | | | | | | move process to auxiliary queue
  22  | | | | | else
  23  | | | | | | move process to new queue
  24  | | | | | end
  25  | | | | end
  26  | | | end
  27  | | end
  28  | | move all nodes from auxiliary queue to queue
  29  | end
  30  end
