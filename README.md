# First Project (INF1019)
The goal of this project is to implement a command interpreter and process scheduler in C programming language, making use of not only the standard C library (mainly signal.h, pthread.h and sys/sem.h) but also modules implemented solely by the student - in this case, just me. The INF1019 Computing Systems course is oriented by the professor Luiz Fernando Bessa Seibel. The list that follows might guide you, newcomer, through this project folder.
* algorithm.txt     Studying the algorithm behind the scheduler
* main.c            Interpreter and scheduler source code
* Makefile          Self explanatory
* prog.c            User program source code
* queue.c           Queue module source code
* queue.h           Queue module header
* semlib.c          Semaphore module source code
* semlib.h          Semaphore module header
* test_queue.c      Queue module automatic test source code
The proper credits for the semaphore module can be found either in its source code or in its header.
