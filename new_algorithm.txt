== Messages

The son process, while running, will send its message parent each second,
notifying that one time unit has passed.

If surpassed the queue quantum, the process will be downgraded. Otherwise,
if the process enters I/O before the quantum, it will be upgraded. If
the process is on the first queue, it can't be upgraded - and on the last queue
it can't be downgraded.

== Processes

Each process has the following information built in it:
* process id - numerical identification generated on fork
* rays count - amount of tasks
* rays - duration of each task in time units
* name - arbitrary identification for the user
* age - time running (in time units)

== I/O

The process is immediately stopped. A thread will sleep for an arbitrary
period of time, simulating an I/O task. When finished, it will be put
on a queue of higher privilege.

== Termination

A process terminates when all rays have been done.
